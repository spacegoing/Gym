We use the livecodebench verification logic directly so we don't need to re-implement all the code parsing, test case run, etc ourselves.
The train data we use is fundamentally different from livecodebench however.

Download the verification data (produced by resources_servers/comp_coding/livecodebench_accuracy_test_prep.py):
```bash
ng_upload_dataset_to_gitlab \
    +dataset_name=livecodebench \
    +version=0.0.1 \
    +input_jsonl_fpath=resources_servers/comp_coding/data/livecodebench_v5_2024-07-01_2025-02-01_validation.jsonl
```

Run the comp coding server via:
```bash
config_paths="responses_api_models/openai_model/configs/openai_model.yaml,\
resources_servers/comp_coding/configs/comp_coding.yaml"
ng_run "+config_paths=[${config_paths}]"
```
